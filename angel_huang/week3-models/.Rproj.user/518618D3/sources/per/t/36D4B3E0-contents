The population is based on UGRD degree-seeking students who were enrolled at census of the Spring 2019 term. The fields named STRM and STRM_DESC describe the term from which the population was pulled. Then for those same students I check their enrollment status in the Fall 2019 term (at census) in order to derive the retention variable. 

## Read the data file

This is the data file provided by Chris.

```{r}
raw_df <- read.csv(file = "../../data/TEST_FILE_WEEK2_V2.csv")
dim(raw_df)
```

```{r}
colnames(raw_df)
```
## Replace missing values

The client has instructed that for 'TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY' and 'TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY', missing values, should be replaced by zeros. We adjust the data set accordingly and use the modified data set for the rest of this file.

```{r}
students_df <- raw_df %>%
  mutate(TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY = ifelse(is.na(TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY),
                                    0,
                                    TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY),
            TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY = ifelse(is.na(TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY),
                                        0,
                                        TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY))
```

## Save the Data

For the next phase of the project, each team member is to start with the data set as modified.

```{r}
save(students_df, file = "students_df.RData")
```

## To use the data

```{r}
load("students_df.RData")
```
