There is no missing value. Good to go.

ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = IS_RETAINED_DESC))

df %>%
  group_by(IS_RETAINED_DESC, IS_RETAINED) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  select(IS_RETAINED, n) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = IS_RETAINED, names_from = IS_RETAINED, values_from = n) %>%
  select(NotRetained = `0`, Retained = `1`) %>%
  mutate(Pct_Retained = round(100* Retained/(Retained + NotRetained), 1))

```

From the bar plot and table, we see that there are about very few students (464, 3.3%) did not return and majority students returned. Note that there is this imbalance of data that we might need to deal with later.

# 2 Explore independent variables
## 2.1 Plot distribution (histogram) for continuous variables
```{r}
p1 = qplot(df$CUM_RESIDENT_TERMS_BOT, geom="histogram", binwidth=1)
p2 = qplot(df$TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY, geom="histogram")
p3 = qplot(df$TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY, geom="histogram")
p4 = qplot(df$CREDIT_HOURS_ATT, geom="histogram")
p5 = qplot(df$CREDIT_HOURS_EARNED, geom="histogram")
# arrange subplots (install gridExtra package)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, ncol = 3) 
```
p1: Cumulative resident terms is mostly 2,4,6, which is because the data is collected in spring 2019 and look at if they return in fall 2019, for most student who started academic year in fall, their cumulative term will be even number, which makes sense. Also, we have even number of 1,2,3 years student and fewer 4th year student since we have excluded seniors who will graduate in fall 2019. (This can also be seen in distribution of class level)

p2,p3: Both transfer units and test credit have a skewed distribution with a long tail. Most of the students have 0 in these categories. Consider using log transform.

p4,p5: Both credit hours attempted and earned centered around 12-17. Use as it is.

# 2.2 Plot distribution for categorical variables
```{r}
# Plot continuous variables against response variable IS_RETAINED_DESC
p1 = ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = IS_RETAINED_DESC, y = CREDIT_HOURS_EARNED)) +
  geom_boxplot()
p2 = ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = IS_RETAINED_DESC, y = CREDIT_HOURS_ATT)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# How different is credit_hours_earned vs. attempted, with regression lines
p3 = ggplot(df, aes(x=CREDIT_HOURS_ATT, y=CREDIT_HOURS_EARNED)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm,fomular=CREDIT_HOURS_EARNED~CREDIT_HOURS_ATT)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1) # arrange subplots (install gridExtra package)
```
It seems like students who returned next term have higher credit_hours_earned this semester. Plot against credit hours attempted has very similar result. After doing correlation, we found the two variables are highly correlated, maybe just 1 is needed in the model?

# 3 Transformation of variables
```{r}
# reorder levels of class
df$CLASS_LEVEL_STUDENT = ordered(df$CLASS_LEVEL_STUDENT, levels = c('FR','SO','JU','SR'))
# log transform variables
df$LOG_TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY = log(df$TRNSFR_UNITS_ENTRY)
df$LOG_TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY = log(df$TEST_CREDIT_ENTRY)

```
I reordered the class level so that it makes more sense -- from low to high grade. Since some variables are skewed, I created log transform of those variables for linear models later.


```{r}
# Plot categorical variables against response variable
ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = IS_RETAINED_DESC, y = CLASS_LEVEL_STUDENT))

df_SR = df[df$IS_RETAINED == 0 & df$CLASS_LEVEL_STUDENT == 'SR',]
ggplot(data = df_SR) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = STRM_DESC, y = FIRST_STRM_DESC))

count(df_SR, 'FIRST_STRM_DESC')
sum(3219+54+3+1)
```
Students who did not return distribute evenly among different grades. 


```{r}
# Subsample dataset to exclude senior data
df_plot = df %>%
  group_by(MAJ_1_SCHOOL_NAME) %>%
  summarise(not_retained = mean(1-IS_RETAINED))
df_plot

```


```{r}
ggplot(df_plot,aes(x = MAJ_1_SCHOOL_NAME, y = not_retained*100)) +  
  geom_col() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,10)) + # has to use coord_cartesian, which doesn't filter on data like ylim does
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =45))  # tilt x label

```
So the majors with the highest "drop" rate is medicine with 7% (this makes sense given the difficulty of the major), and then arts and sciences with 5%, and then Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, and business, each around 4%.
